<p><strong>Front end development</strong> is the development of those elements of a website that the customer sees and interacts with directly. It is a combination of programming skills (knowing which program to choose) and aesthetics (understanding element arrangements on the screen, the color and font choices). The challenges associated with front end developers is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.</p>

<p>The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device), which needs careful planning on the site of the developer.</p>
